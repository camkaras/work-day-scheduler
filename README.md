# work-day-scheduler

In the project I have been tasked with creating an interactive calender app which, displays the current day at the top of the page as well as creating timeblocks for the user to fill out. 
when the user fills out a timeblock the data entered must be saved to local storage. the timeblocks must also be colour code based on the current day and time.

In my project i was able to successfully to use moment.js to display the current date at the top of the page as well as to convert the text displayed in the p element of the timeblock into a moment in order to comapre it to the moment at the top of the page. The purpose of this comparison is to see if the current time is before, after or the same as the timeblock.

I was also able to save the users text entry to local storage without any issues.
