# work-day-scheduler

In the project I have been tasked with creating an interactive calender app which, displays the current day at the top of the page as well as creating timeblocks for the user to fill out. 
when the user fills out a timeblock the data entered must be saved to local storage. the timeblocks must also be colour code based on the current day and time.
